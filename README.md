## ![GNU icon][gnu icon] Stow

Adding files to stow symlink:

    (_in ~/dotfiles/dotfiles_)

        mkdir folder_structure_that_contains_the_file     # skip if it's inside ~/
        touch file_name
        ```

2.  Move files with the same name than those we created with "touch" to our dotfiles folder replacing our "touch" files and create links that replace mgces from the home directory

    ```
    stow --adopt -nvt ~ dotfiles/

    ```

Flags:

- -n Do nothing, just to see the effects of the command beforehand
- -v Verbose
- -t Target folder where links will be created "~"
- --adopt Moves the existing files to the -d "destination" folder, without it, just links will be created
