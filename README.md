## ![GNU icon][GNU icon] Stow 
#### Adding files to stow symlink:

1. Create files with the same name of those we want to add to the repo
(_in ~/dotfiles/dotfiles_)

    ```
    mkdir folder_structure_that_contains_the_file     # skip if it's inside ~/
    touch file_name
    ```
2. Move files with the same name than those we created with "touch" to our dotfiles folder replacing our "touch" files and create links that replace mgces from the home directory

    ```
    stow --adopt -nvt ~ dotfiles/ 

    ```
#### Flags: 
* -n Do nothing, just to see the effects of the command beforehand
* -v Verbose 
* -t Target folder where links will be created "~"
* --adopt Moves the existing files to the -d "destination" folder, without it, just links will be created

#### Cloning the repo and creating symlinks to the files 

Steps:
```
cd ~
mkdir dotfiles
cd dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/Pol-Gil/ArchDotfiles
stow -nvt ~ dotfiles/
```
